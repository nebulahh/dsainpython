# DSAINPYTHON

I am learning DSA so i will push four answers to this repo weekly. All questions can be found on leetcode

## language used and site 

**language used:** python because i am trying to learn the language
**site used:** leetcode and neetcode
**other tool:** a book and pen

## thought process

When i cant solve the question, after attempting it for several minutes, i go on YT to watch someone explanation. I will jot down the whole explanation, dig deep and re-read the parts i dont understand, then try to solve the question from the explanation in my notes and return to the video if i get stuck.
